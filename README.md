# RayTracerJava

In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

The technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, more so than typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.

## Result
   ![Ray Traced Image](output.bmp)

## Building and Running

Tested with Windows and Linux using:

- Java SDK 16
- Gradle
- IntelliJ IDEA Community 2021

Import the gradle project into IDEA. Build the project and run module SimpleRT. The output image will be output.bmp in the root project folder.
